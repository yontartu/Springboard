# Springboard Repo
Springboard's Data Science Intensive Workshop

Three potential capstone project ideas:

* #1 **Baseball data**: My interest here is in exploring how to predict the likelihood of an ejection (of either a coach or player) -- given a host of environmental and historical variables -- and as a derivative question, whether an ejection of a coach leads to  improvement or worsening of a team's performance in the short run. 
* #2 **Public transit data**: I'm interested in exploring public transit data, for example from the DC metro system or from DC's Capital Bikeshare program. I'd be interested in predictive puzzles that potentially combine the two data sources -- for instance, does higher usage of bikeshare in certain geographic areas cause metro ridership to dip?
* #3 **NLP & trade agreements**: A third idea I had is to explore trade agreements, such as the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but I'm not sure about what specific research questions might come out of this.
