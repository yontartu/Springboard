# Springboard Repo
Springboard's Data Science Intensive Workshop

Three potential capstone project ideas:

* #1 **Baseball data**: My interest here is in exploring how to predict the likelihood of an ejection (of either a coach or player) -- given a host of environmental and historical variables -- and as a derivative question, whether an ejection of a coach leads to  improvement or worsening of a team's performance in the short run. Link to data source: [Retrosheet play-by-play data](http://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm#5). 
* #2 **Public transit data**: I'm interested in exploring public transit data, for example from the DC metro system or from DC's Capital Bikeshare program. I'd be interested in predictive puzzles that potentially combine the two data sources -- for instance, does higher usage of bikeshare in certain geographic areas cause metro ridership to dip? Link to data sources: [Capital Bikeshare historical data](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data), [DC Metro data](https://developer.wmata.com/).
* #3 **NLP & Hillary Clinton emails**: A third idea I had is to explore the [Hillary Clinton email dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails/kernels) up on Kaggle, but I'll admit this idea is certainly the least well-thought-out of the three. Perhaps it might be interesting to combine with [this](https://wp.nyu.edu/ericarias/data/) historical dataset on ambassador appointments.
